Only use auth.ts and auth.api methods serverside. To use them you have to pass Next.js headers as follows:
auth.api.hasPermission({
  headers: await headers(),
    body: {
      permissions: {
        project: ["create"] // This must match the structure in your access control
      }
    }
});
 


 Only use auth-client.ts and authClient on clienside. You do not need to pass headers, it's already contextually aware.

 const canCreateProject = await authClient.organization.hasPermission({
    permissions: {
        project: ["create"]
    }
})

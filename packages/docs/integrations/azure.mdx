2. Click on **Connect** next to the Azure integration card
3. Select the integration method:
   - **Option 1**: Azure App Registration (Recommended)
     - Register a new application in Azure AD using the provided template
     - Grant the application reader access to your target subscriptions
     - Enter the application details in Comp AI
   - **Option 2**: Service Principal
     - Create a service principal with reader role
     - Enter the client ID, client secret, and tenant ID in Comp AI
4. Configure scan settings:
   - Scan frequency
   - Target subscriptions and resource groups
   - Notification preferences
5. Click **Save and Connect**

## Capabilities

### Security Tests

The Azure integration performs the following security assessments:

| Test Category | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| IAM Analysis | Review Azure AD roles and custom RBAC assignments |
| Storage Security | Identify improperly configured storage account permissions and encryption |
| VM Security | Analyze NSGs, VM configurations, and patch status |
| Database Security | Check Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, and other database security settings |
| Activity Logs | Verify proper logging and monitoring configuration |
| Key Vault | Validate secret management and key rotation policies |
| Network | Assess VNet configurations, NSGs, and service endpoints |

### Compliance Frameworks

The integration checks compliance against:

- Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark
- SOC 2
- HIPAA (where applicable)
- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- ISO 27001

## Managing Access

### Access Control

Comp AI requires read-only access to your Azure environment. The integration uses Azure's built-in Reader role or custom roles with specific permissions that follow the principle of least privilege.

### Permissions

The Azure application/service principal has permissions for:

- Reading resource configurations
- Listing resources and their attributes
- Viewing diagnostic settings

The integration does NOT have permissions to:
- Modify any resources
- Create new resources
- Delete existing resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Failed to connect Azure subscription  
**Solution**: Verify service principal credentials and role assignments

**Issue**: Missing scan results for specific services  
**Solution**: Check RBAC permissions for those specific resource providers

**Issue**: Authentication errors  
**Solution**: Ensure the service principal hasn't expired and secret is valid

# AWS Integration

The AWS integration allows you to connect your AWS infrastructure to Comp AI for automated security testing, compliance monitoring, and risk assessment.

## Setup Process

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, ensure you have:

1. AWS account with administrator access
2. Admin access to your Comp AI workspace
3. IAM permissions to create cross-account roles

### Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** in your Comp AI dashboard
2. Click on **Connect** next to the AWS integration card
3. Select the integration method:
   - **Option 1**: CloudFormation Stack (Recommended)
     - Download the CloudFormation template
     - Deploy the template in your AWS account
     - The template will create the necessary IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
   - **Option 2**: Manual Setup
     - Create an IAM role with external ID
     - Add the provided policy document
     - Enter the role ARN in Comp AI
4. Configure scan settings:
   - Scan frequency
   - Target accounts and regions
   - Notification preferences
5. Click **Save and Connect**

## Capabilities

### Security Tests

The AWS integration performs the following security assessments:

| Test Category | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| IAM Analysis | Review IAM policies and roles for excessive permissions |
| S3 Security | Identify improperly configured bucket permissions and encryption |
| EC2 Security | Analyze security groups, instance configurations, and patch status |
| RDS Security | Check database security settings and encryption |
| CloudTrail | Verify proper logging and monitoring configuration |
| KMS Usage | Validate encryption key usage and rotation policies |
| Network | Assess VPC configurations, NACLs, and security groups |

### Compliance Frameworks

The integration checks compliance against:

- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- SOC 2
- HIPAA (where applicable)
- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- ISO 27001

## Managing Access

### Access Control

Comp AI requires read-only access to your AWS environment. The integration uses a custom IAM role with specific permissions that follow the principle of least privilege.

### Permissions

The created IAM role has permissions for:

- Describing resources (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.)
- Reading configurations and settings
- Listing resources and their attributes

The integration does NOT have permissions to:
- Modify any resources
- Create new resources
- Delete existing resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Failed to connect AWS account  
**Solution**: Verify IAM role trust relationship and external ID

**Issue**: Missing scan results for specific services  
**Solution**: Check IAM permissions for those specific services

**Issue**: Incomplete region coverage  
**Solution**: Update region settings in the integration configuration

2. Click on **Connect** next to the GCP integration card
3. Select the integration method:
   - **Option 1**: Service Account (Recommended)
     - Create a service account in your GCP project
     - Download the service account key (JSON)
     - Upload the key to Comp AI
   - **Option 2**: Terraform
     - Use the provided Terraform module
     - Apply the configuration to your GCP environment
     - Enter the created service account details in Comp AI
4. Configure scan settings:
   - Scan frequency
   - Target projects and services

## Capabilities

### Security Tests

The GCP integration performs the following security assessments:

| Test Category | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| IAM Analysis | Review IAM roles and service account permissions |
| GCS Security | Identify improperly configured bucket permissions and encryption |
| Compute Security | Analyze firewall rules, instance configurations, and patch status |
| Database Security | Check Cloud SQL, Firestore, and other database security settings |
| Cloud Logging | Verify proper logging and monitoring configuration |
| KMS | Validate encryption key usage and rotation policies |
| Network | Assess VPC configurations, firewall rules, and load balancer settings |

### Compliance Frameworks

The integration checks compliance against:

- CIS GCP Foundation Benchmark
- SOC 2
- HIPAA (where applicable)
- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- ISO 27001

## Managing Access

### Access Control

Comp AI requires read-only access to your GCP environment. The integration uses a service account with specific IAM roles that follow the principle of least privilege.

### Permissions

The service account has the following roles:

- Viewer (roles/viewer) at project level
- Security Reviewer (roles/iam.securityReviewer)
- Storage Object Viewer (roles/storage.objectViewer)

The integration does NOT have permissions to:
- Modify any resources
- Create new resources
- Delete existing resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Failed to connect GCP project  
**Solution**: Verify service account key and IAM permissions

**Issue**: Missing scan results for specific services  
**Solution**: Check IAM permissions for those specific services

**Issue**: Authentication errors  
**Solution**: Ensure the service account key is valid and not expired
